Day 10 project: python-calculator

This project is part of the course 100 Days of Code - The Complete Pyhton Pro Bootcamp for 2021 presented by Dr. Angela Yu, the lead instructor at the London App Brewery, London's leading Programming Bootcamp. The course is available @ udemy/course/100-days-of-code/

The task of the project was to build a calculator using python. Everything was created from scratch without being provided any beginning code. 

There are multiple ways of finishing the project, so the chances of having 100% the same line of code as the teacher or other students is very low. But, slight resemblances might appear here and there.

As a personal touch, besides the 4 major calculator operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide) I have added the following operations:
- Exponent
- Percentage
- Modulo operator
